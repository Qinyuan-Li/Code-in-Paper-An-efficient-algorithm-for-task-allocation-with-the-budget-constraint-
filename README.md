"general_set.ipynb": run and save the results of those algorithms.
“vis_gen.ipynb”: draw the figures.
“gen_setting”: data used in thesis (get from “general_set.ipynb”, and draw by “vis_gen.ipynb”).
====================================================================================================
Codes for Figure 6-3: Compare with the optimal.
"compare_with_opt.ipynb": run and save the results of those algorithms.
